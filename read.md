In this task, the most challenging part was figuring out how to update a tree. Firstly, I thought that I needed to add a new part to the previous question, and was confused. But then, together with Audrey Kim, we realized that we can set new data to the wrong guess, and then add the following nodes to it.

Also, the useful part of this task was to understand when I need to use the recursion in the binary tree, and when it's not necessary (f.e. breadth traversal and depth traversal).

I think that after I understood these parts, I worked on reading and writing into files. I spent some time on string manipulations so that the AnimalTree will not have extra spaces.
